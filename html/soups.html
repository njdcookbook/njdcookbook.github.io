              <p class="recipe">This is the point to say: no matter where you live, buy a hand-blender. It WILL come in handy. So tomato soup, at it's very-most simple: buy a can (or two, depending on the size) of crushed or quartered tomatoes. Heat up and blend. Salt and pepper to taste. Drizzling with olive oil is always good. As is serving with grilled cheese. -SRD </p>

              <p class="recipe"> Get 1 whole free-range chicken, + assortment of herbs + whatever root vegetables around: carrots, celery, onions, garlic, turnip, thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, etc. Throw it all in big pot, cover with cold water. Throw in any old chicken bones from freezer. Bring to a bloil. Lower heat to medium and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, partly covered, til chicken is done. Skim surface every so often as it cooks.Take out chicken, put on chopping block. Once cool, shred off meat. Strain stock into another pot. Discard vegetables. Cover and refrigerate or freeze. Once you're ready to make the matza ball soup, throw some new vegetables and the shredded chicken back in. For the matza balls: 1 c. matzo meal
4 large eggs,
1 tsp kosher salt,
4 tbsp oil or 4 tbsp melted schmaltz,
2 tsp baking powder. Follow instructions carefully: Measure and mix dry ingredients in bowl.

Individually break eggs into a clear glass, then pour into a second bowl.

Add oil/schmaltz to eggs, stir gently with a fork til the yolks are broken and the oil just mixed.

Pour egg mixture into the dry mixture, gently mix with the fork.

DO NOT OVER MIX.

If you over mix they will be tough.

Put in the fridge for 1 hr.

Bring stock to a rolling boil on the stove.

After matzo ball mix has set, gently remove teaspoon fulls of the batter and roll into 1-2" balls and drop into the soup.

When all the balls are in soup leave it to boil until all the balls float to the top, then lower the temperature to a rolling simmer for 40 minutes--ready!
