              <p class="recipe">'About hamburgers: I don't have a recipe, really. I don't add anything to
the patties (although some people do). I do smear them with some olive oil
before cooking them. I cook them over direct heat for no more than 5
minutes on a side and probably not less than three (the heat of wood fires
is so various, you can't really specify cooking times for barbecue). Unlike
other meat, though, hamburgers don't suffer if they're overcooked a bit,
especially if you've chosen a fatty cut. I never barbecue without adding a
handful of some sort of wood chip, usually soaked for at least an hour, to
the charcoal. Unlike other things I cook, I might turn burgers a bit more
frequently since the meat is so moist: I like to keep that moisture in the
meat, cooking it evenly, rather than having it drain out. For that reason,
NEVER press the patties down flat as they're cooking (as some people do).
If you're concerned about the dimensions of the patty (as they shrink on
the grill, they also thicken) then consider how they'll cook as you form
the raw patty. If your fire is sufficiently hot, you should sear them on
both sides and then cook them a bit more slowly on both sides. Cover them
after turning them. I think burgers made with fatty chuck or sirloin are
the best (as opposed to lean ground beef).' </p>
