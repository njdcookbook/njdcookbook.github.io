              <p class="recipe">Cook white rice, ideally with minimal effort in a rice cooker. Fry an egg sunny-side-up, careful to leave it runny. Ghee, olive oil, or peanut oil depending on how you want it to taste. Form the rice into a beautiful mound, season the egg with salt and pepper. Sounds simple but you'll never look back. Add Tamari, hot sauce, or stuff to the rice for variations. You can also add a slice of ham, cheese, or both between the egg and the rice. You can even put ginger flakes (as in the picture), on top. Or caramelized onion. Or parsley. Go crazy and enjoy. Side salad recommended. -SRD </p>

              <p class="recipe">THE EASIEST QUICHE-CRUST EVER (adapted from online)<br/>Ingredients:
1 cup flour,
1/2 teaspoon salt,
1/4 cup olive oil,
1/4 cup ice water ( I use refrigerated water) <br/>
Directions:
1. Mix flour and salt with fork.
2. Beat oil and water with whisk or fork to thicken.
3. Pour into flour and mix with fork.
4. Press into 9" pie crust.
5. Fill with quiche mixture and bake at 400F until done (30ish min).
 <br/><br/>QUICHE FORMULA (Enchanted brocolli forest)<br/> FIRST, the cheese. The cheese goes first because, when melted, it forms a moisture-resistent barrier between the filling and the crust, thus helping to keep the crust from getting soggy. Recommended types: Swiss (especially gruyere) and medium or sharp cheddar. Recommended amount: 1/4 – 1/3 lb, depending on: a) whether it is cubed or grated (grated takes up less space); b) how much filling you’re using; c) whether you’re using a quiche pan (straight-sided) or a pie pan. SECOND: Filling. Your choice. THIRD, the custard. After you apply the filling over the cheese, beat together 3 eggs and 1 cup milk (4 eggs and 1 1/2 cups milk for a straight-sided quiche pan). Pour it over the top. Dust the top with paprika. </p>

              <p class="recipe">'Penne all'arrabbiata  (Angry penne)<br/><br/>

Penne rigati,
1 pack bacon (about 1/3 of a pound) clipped with scissors or cut in small squares,
1-2 pepperoncini (small, dry red peppers, very hot),
1 clove crushed garlic,
1 lb. canned tomatoes,
salt and pepper to taste,
1/3 cup cream <br/><br/>


Start boiling water. Fry bacon in a little bit olive oil. Take them up and put on absorbent paper towels. Drain bacon fat out of pan and put olive oil in again and slowly sauté the garlic and pepperoncini. Add canned tomatoes and simmer until liquid is boiled somewhat in, and the tomatoes are broken down. Add bacon, adjust with salt and pepper, and add cream to round out the taste. Put the penne in the sauce and serve with grated parmesan cheese.<br/><br/>

This is our daughter's absolute favorite. She loves how easy it is to make.' -JD
<br/><br/> Additional note: 'Maybe you should write that Nathan should pour the boiled penne in the sauce.' -JD

garlic,
onion,
1 tsp basil dried or more fresh,
1 tsp oregano dried or more fresh,
salt, pepper,
1 lb. can of tomatoes,
eventually a tsp or two of capers,
1-2 eggs,
Parmesan cheese grated<br/>Sauté onion and garlic until onions are translucent. I like a whole garlic glove or a gently mashed one. Add oregano and basil if using dried. Sauté the herbs a little bit. Add tomatoes and juices. Let the tomatoes simmer until the sauce thickens and the tomatoes are broken down. Adjust acidity with a little bit of sugar or/and a pinch of baking soda. Adjust salt and pepper. I like to put in capers here. Make little nests in the tomato sause with a spoon and open an egg in the depression. Put a lid on. The egg(s) are then fried, steamed, and boiled until the whites are firm but the yolks are semi-runny. Add at this point basil and oregano if using fresh herbs. Spoon the egg and sauce onto the spaghetti and top with parmesan.<br/>*We bought our bread from the bread lady in Pisa. She gave me this recipe when she still thought I was a contender for her daughter's hand in marriage, a daughter I was never introduced to but heard about. She was very rude to Anne Sophie, telling me among other things that the nordic women were very lazy.'-JD </p>

              <p class="recipe">' (just be sure not to OVERDO this recipe day in and day out just because you like it a lot on Day 1.)<br/><br/>

At Whole Foods, buy:<br/>
3 or 4  jars of Indian simmer sauce of your choosing--Masala, Korma, etc.,
1 green pepper,
1 onion,
garlic,
a few carrots,
bag of frozen spinach (optional),
1 lime,
i  bunch parsley or cilantro,
2 or 3 boneless chicken breasts,
rice,

Set up a batch of rice to cook (1/2 cup rice to a little more than a cup of water; simmer for about 45 minutes).
While rice is cooking, in a quarter cup olive oil, sautee in a large sauce pan or wok: chopped garlic, onion, pepper, carrot for a few minutes, NOT too much. Plop the chicken breast in the middle (either cut up into pieces or whole), optional spinach. Pour a jar of simmer sauce over this, cover the pot, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about a half hour or so, maybe less depending on the size of the breasts and whether you cut them into pieces or not. Serve over rice with some fresh snips of either parseley or cilantro and a lime wedge.' -ILS<br/><br/> Note from SRD: I HIGHLY recommend purchasing a rice cooker. It makes life SO much easier and more well-fed. </p>
