              <p class="recipe">Cook white rice, ideally with minimal effort in a rice cooker. Fry an egg sunny-side-up, careful to leave it runny. Ghee, olive oil, or peanut oil depending on how you want it to taste. Form the rice into a beautiful mound, season the egg with salt and pepper. Sounds simple but you'll never look back. Add Tamari, hot sauce, or stuff to the rice for variations. You can also add a slice of ham, cheese, or both between the egg and the rice. You can even put ginger flakes (as in the picture), on top. Or caramelized onion. Or parsley. Go crazy and enjoy. Side salad recommended. -SRD </p>

              <p class="recipe">Bread lady's pasta*<br/>'Spaghetti,
garlic,
onion,
1 tsp basil dried or more fresh,
1 tsp oregano dried or more fresh,
salt, pepper,
1 lb. can of tomatoes,
eventually a tsp or two of capers,
1-2 eggs,
Parmesan cheese grated<br/>Sauté onion and garlic until onions are translucent. I like a whole garlic glove or a gently mashed one. Add oregano and basil if using dried. Sauté the herbs a little bit. Add tomatoes and juices. Let the tomatoes simmer until the sauce thickens and the tomatoes are broken down. Adjust acidity with a little bit of sugar or/and a pinch of baking soda. Adjust salt and pepper. I like to put in capers here. Make little nests in the tomato sause with a spoon and open an egg in the depression. Put a lid on. The egg(s) are then fried, steamed, and boiled until the whites are firm but the yolks are semi-runny. Add at this point basil and oregano if using fresh herbs. Spoon the egg and sauce onto the spaghetti and top with parmesan.<br/>*We bought our bread from the bread lady in Pisa. She gave me this recipe when she still thought I was a contender for her daughter's hand in marriage, a daughter I was never introduced to but heard about. She was very rude to Anne Sophie, telling me among other things that the nordic women were very lazy.'-JD </p>
