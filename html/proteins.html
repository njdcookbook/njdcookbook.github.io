              <p class="recipe"> Yes it's that easy. Don't use salt that's too fine, though, or it'll be too salty. Salt grains too big == not salty enough. Fresh-ground pepper is the best. Feel free to toss some root vegetables underneath--parsnip, onion, carrot, turnip, etc are all great. Sometimes I put some garlic in the cavity. Or bay. Or both. -SRD</p>

turkey burger recipe:<br/>

Ingredients:
Ground turkey meat (if making for enough people, prefer a mix of low-fat
and higher-fat. otherwise just go with higher-fat for stickiness),
A-1 Steak Sauce,
Hot sauce (prefer Louisiana hot sauce),
Cavender's Greek Seasoning (rather hard to replace, and if you are afraid
of MSG i believe it contains it. i have used a mix of pepper, salt, basil,
oregano, thyme, garlic, and a tiny bit of nutmeg.)<br/>


Process:

I usually use four packages of 0.75lb ground turkey to make a large number
of burgers, an entire bottle of A-1, and copious (but not overwhelming)
amounts of hot sauce and seasoning.

Mix ground turkey, half the amount of A-1, hot sauce, and seasoning in
large bowl. Your hands will be cold. Form into dense patties.

Cook evenly over medium-high heat, flipping often. I usually start at very
high heat for the first two flips to ensure the patties don't fall apart,
then lower to medium. For the first few flips, dash with hot sauce, A-1, or
seasoning. You can really go to town on it.

I usually try to drink a beer or two while making these. If you do the
same, feel free to add a small splash of the beer to the skillet.

Serve with normal burger fixings (I prefer: red onion, lettuce, tomato,
horseradish mustard, sharp cheese, good bun. if extremely fancy, garnish
with dill.)<br/>

Optional:
Saute onions and/or mushrooms in the skillet while cooking the burgers.' -BS</p>
